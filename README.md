F1 data pipeline

My goal for this project is to get used to using an api and pulling, cleaning, transforming data, and loading it into a postgres database. 

Plans:
- Pull data from OpenF1 API
- use pySpark to put into AWS S3 
- implement multi hop architecture (bronze, silver, gold)
- clean data and move to silver
- aggregate and move to gold
- use a tool for automation (probably airflow)
- monitor using prometheous and grafana
