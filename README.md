F1 data dashboard

My goal for this project is to get used to using an api and pulling, cleaning, transforming data, and loading it into a postgres database. I might add in airflow to automate pulling data every so often, although for this data set there probably isnt much need for it.

Plans:
- load data in through the F1 api
- clean the data
- tansform the data to a useable format to be able to perform analytics
- load data into a postgres database
