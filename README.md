F1 data dashboard

My goal for this project is to get used to using an api and pulling, cleaning, and transforming data. I would also like to have an interactive dashboard to display interesting insights from the data. 

Plans:
- work on my data loader to load the type of data I need.
- work on my data processor to clean data and transform data so it is ready for plotting
- work on a dashboard to easily be able to drill into the data
